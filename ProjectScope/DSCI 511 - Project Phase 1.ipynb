    "I’m currently in Drexel University’s Economics Master Program. I’ve worked extensively with large data sets where I have used econometric techniques to analyze data. I have used various programming languages such as R, Stata, EViews, and Python (although I am a beginner with Python). My area of expertise lies in data analysis, data interpretation, and econometric modeling. I’m interested in learning more about Python, APIs, how to web scrape, and creating a data pipeline.\n",

    "## What is Our Data and Purpose\n",
    "The dataset that we’re hoping to accomplish is data from the NBA Advanced Stats page. We want to scrape statistics about all the NBA teams and the players on each team. And for each player, we’ll find out their personal information, like their uniform number, the position they play, height, weight, birth date, and years of experience. We’ll also be interested in getting their game statistics, like points per game (PPG), rebounds per game (RPG), assists per game (APG), player impact estimate (PIE), and more. We hope the dataset collected will be good for creating an NBA team/player dashboard, visually showcasing each team’s and player’s stats. We also hope to create a predictor model that’s able to pick the winner given two teams with a high level of accuracy. "

    "According to the NBA’s FAQ, a player or team’s base statistics are updated simultaneously with the game and in real time. The advanced stats are updated between 10-15 minutes after a game finishes. Additionally, the NBA uses an optical tracking system that utilizes multiple cameras placed in the catwalks in all 29 NBA arenas. The cameras receive and update data at a rate of 25 frames per second. The cameras feed the data into proprietary software, where computer vision algorithms extract positional data for all players on the court and the ball. Player tracking systems introduce many new statistics, automate data collection, and provide precision, which would be impossible without the use of camera technology and tracking software.\n"

Therefore, we can assume there’s no public API, so we’ll have to build our own. We’ll have to scrape the data. Given that it’s a static webpage, we’re able to use the requests module to get the HTML of the page. However, we’ll have to use Selenium to get the page contents if it's a dynamic webpage. Then we can get the data we want with the BeautifulSoup module. The Pandas module also has helpful in parsing HTML tables and turning them into DataFrames.\n",
